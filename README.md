Overview
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and manage various operations within a hospital. 
This project was developed using Java for the application logic and MySQL for data storage.
It leverages JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interface between the Java application and the MySQL database, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. 
The system allows for updating, inserting, and deleting data from the database, ensuring dynamic management of hospital records.

Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used to develop the application. Java provides a robust and platform-independent environment for building scalable and maintainable applications.
MySQL: The relational database management system used to store and manage the data related to patients, doctors, and appointments.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): The API used to connect the Java application to the MySQL database. 
JDBC facilitates the execution of SQL queries and retrieval of results, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Functional Components

Patient Management:
Data Stored: Patient ID, Name, Age, Gender
Description: This module handles the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of patient records.
It ensures that all patient information is securely stored in the database and can be accessed or modified as required.

Doctor Management:
Data Stored: Doctor ID, Name, Specialization
Description: This module manages the information related to doctors, including their unique IDs, names, and areas of specialization.
It supports the efficient allocation of doctors to patients based on their medical needs.

Hospital Management:
Data Stored: ID, Patient ID, Doctor ID, Appointment Date
Description: This module oversees the scheduling and management of appointments. It links patients with doctors and ensures that appointment dates are appropriately recorded and managed.

CRUD Operations
Insert Data: The system allows new records to be added to the patient, doctor, and appointment tables. For instance, new patient registrations, doctor enlistments, and appointment bookings.
Update Data: Existing records in the database can be modified as needed. This includes updating patient information, doctor details, and rescheduling appointments.
Delete Data: The system supports the deletion of records from the database, enabling the removal of outdated or incorrect entries.

Uses and Benefits
Improved Efficiency: Automating the management of patients, doctors, and appointments reduces the manual workload and minimizes the chances of human error.
Centralized Data Management: All critical data is stored in a centralized database, making it easier to access, manage, and maintain the information.
Dynamic Data Management: The ability to insert, update, and delete records ensures that the system can adapt to the evolving needs of the hospital.
Scalability: The use of Java and MySQL ensures that the system can be easily scaled to accommodate the growing needs of the hospital.

Conclusion:
The Hospital Management System effectively addresses the need for a structured and automated approach to managing hospital operations.
By leveraging Java for the application logic and MySQL for data storage, the system provides a reliable and efficient solution for handling patient, doctor, and appointment information.
The use of JDBC ensures seamless communication between the application and the database, facilitating smooth data transactions. The inclusion of CRUD operations makes the system highly dynamic and adaptable.
